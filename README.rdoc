= Simple background loops framework for rails and merb

loops is a small and lightweight framework for Ruby on Rails and Merb created to support simple 
background loops in your application which are usually used to do some background data processing 
on your servers (queue workers, batch tasks processors, etc).


== What tasks could you use it for?

Originally loops plugin was created to make our own loops code more organized. We used to have tens 
of different modules with methods that were called with script/runner and then used with nohup and 
other not so convenient backgrounding techniques. When you have such a number of loops/workers to 
run in background it becomes a nightmare to manage them on a regular basis (restarts, code upgrades, 
status/health checking, etc).

After a short time of writing our loops in more organized ways we were able to generalize most of the 
loops code so now our loops look like a classes with a single mandatory public method called *run*. 
Everything else (spawning many workers, managing them, logging, backgrounding, pid-files management, 
etc) is handled by the plugin itself.


== How to install?

To install this plugin you need to do a few steps:
* To install the plugin, you can use the following command:

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/kovyrin/loops.git

This will install the whole package in your vendor/plugins directory.
For merb applications, just check out the code and place it to the vendor/plugins directory.

* Generate binary and configuration files by running 

    ./script/generate loops 

This will create the following list of files:
* ./script/loops - binary file that will be used to manage your loops
* ./config/loops.yml - example configuration file
* ./app/loops/simple.rb - REALLY simple loop example
* ./app/loops/queue_loop.rb - simple ActiveMQ queue worker


== How to use?

Here is a simple loop scaffold for you to start from (put this file to app/loops/hello_world_loop.rb):

  class HelloWorldLoop < Loops::Base
    def run
      with_period_of(1) do # period is in seconds
        debug("Hello, debug log!")
        sleep(config['sleep_period']) # Do something "useful" and make it configurable
        debug("Hello, debug log (yes, once again)!")
      end
    end
  end

When you have your loop ready to use, add the following lines to your (maybe empty yet) config/loops.yml 
file:

  hello_world:
    type: simple
    sleep_period: 10

This is it! To start your loop, just run one of the following commands:

* To list all configured loops:

    $ ./script/loops -l

* To run all enabled (actually non-disabled) loops in foreground:

    $ ./script/loops

* To run all enabled loops in background:

    $ ./script/loops -d

* To run specific loop in background:

    $ ./script/loops -d -l hello_world

* To see all possible options:

    $ ./script/loops -h


== What Ruby implementations does it work for?

We've tested and use the plugin on MRI 1.8.6 and on JRuby 1.1.5. At this point we do not support 
daemonization in JRuby and never tested the code on Ruby 1.9. Obviously because of JVM limitations 
you won't be able to use +fork+ workers engine in JRuby, but threaded workers do pretty well.


== Who are the authors?

This plugin has been created in Scribd.com for our internal use and then the sources were opened 
for other people to use. All the code in this package has been developed by Alexey Kovyrin and 
Dmytro Shteflyuk for Scribd.com and is released under the GPLv2 license. For more details,
